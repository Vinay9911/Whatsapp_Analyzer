# Whatsapp_Analyzer

I deployed a robust Streamlit application designed to allow users to upload WhatsApp chat files for detailed analysis. The application automatically generates a comprehensive report that provides deep insights into user interactions. It includes dynamic visualizations such as heatmaps for identifying peak messaging times and word clouds to highlight frequently used terms. Beyond these, the platform is equipped with advanced features like criminal pattern analysis using NLP techniques to detect suspicious activity, link extraction to gather URLs shared in the conversations, sentiment analysis to gauge emotional tones, and entity recognition to extract key names and places. These capabilities make it a powerful tool for both casual users and those needing detailed investigative reports.
